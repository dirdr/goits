## Assumptions 🧑‍🔬

- **Single Currency:** All accounts operate under the same currency.
- **No Authentication/Authorization:** The API endpoints are publicly accessible without any authentication or authorization mechanisms.

> [!WARNING]
> Given these assumptions and the fact that this project is a simple test service, do not use it as a real money transfer system!

## Technical Requirements ⚙️

Working with money transfers necessitates the use of certain paradigms. This project uses various mechanisms to ensure data consistency and integrity:

1. Event Sourcing (as a source of truth for transactions)
2. Double-entry bookkeeping to check at all times that $T_{credit} = T_{debit}$
3. Optimistic locking inside `account_balances` projection to prevent lost updates while not holding locks for too long

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

Docker and Compose plugin.

### Run

For easier setup and management of the application and its dependencies (like PostgreSQL), Docker Compose is encouraged:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in environment variables
3. **Start the services:**

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

### Test

You can run business rule unit tests with Go tests:

```sh
go test ./test/... -v
```

### API Endpoints

Swagger documentation is available to view API descriptions and interact with endpoints. Navigate to [Swagger](http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html#/) (Replace the port with the one you set in the `.env` file).
