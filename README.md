1. Event Sourcing (as a source of truth for transactions)
2. Double bookkeeping to check at all time that $T_{credit} = T_{debit}$
3. Optimistic locking of the account_balances to prevent lost update while not taking lock for too long

## Getting Started

   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

### Test

You can run business rules unit test with go tests:

```sh
go test ./test/... -v

```

### API Endpoints

A Swagger book is available to see API description and play with endpoints, head down to [Swager](http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html#/) (Replace the port by the one you set in the `.env` file)
